# Contributing

The following is a set of guidelines/rules for contributing to the repository.

## Ask a question

Generally speaking questions are better suited in our resources below.

- [Github Discussions Q&A](https://github.com/PaulMarisOUMary/Discord-Bot/discussions/43)
- [Documentation](https://github.com/PaulMarisOUMary/Discord-Bot#readme)

Please do not ask questions on the issue tracker. Most of them don't belong there unless they provide value to a larger audience.

## Issue tracker

1. Don't open duplicate issues. Please search your issue to see if it has been asked already. Duplicate issues will be closed.

2. When filing a bug about exceptions or tracebacks, please include the complete traceback. Without the complete traceback the issue might be unsolvable and you will be asked to provide more information.

3. Please follow the issue template related to your issue.

## Pull requests

1. Make sure it focuses on a single aspect and doesn't manage to have scope creep.

2. Please follow the pull request template.

## Code Guidelines

:warning: Strongly recommended to use [conventions of the repository](https://github.com/PaulMarisOUMary/Discord-Bot/blob/main/.github/CONVENTIONS.md).

## Git commit Guidelines

- Use present tense (e.g. "Add feature" not "Added feature").

- Limit all lines to 72 characters or less.

- Reference issues or pull requests outside of the first line. 
    - (Please use the shorthand #123 and not the full URL.)
